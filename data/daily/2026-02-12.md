## AI Narrative Summary

On February 12, 2026, development activity focused on the lecturer dashboard across the backend and frontend repositories. Efforts were concentrated on extending task management capabilities, specifically regarding group task data retrieval and the comprehensive integration of task and learning material workflows for lecturers. Significant progress was made in UI slicing, API integration, and the supporting service architecture to enable creating, editing, and previewing educational content.

**Major Contributions:**

*   **Backend (spmb-cakrawala-be):**
    *   Implemented query parameters to facilitate the retrieval of group task data within the lecturer dashboard.
    *   Modified the task log module, including updates to controllers, request/response models, repositories, and services to support the new query logic.

*   **Frontend (edlink-cakrawala):**
    *   Integrated APIs for the task preview functionality to allow lecturers to review assignments before publication.
    *   Completed UI slicing and API integration for the creation, modification, and previewing of both tasks and learning materials.
    *   Developed and updated multiple hooks for task management, including useCreateTask, useUpdateTask, useTaskById, and useTaskLogPagination.
    *   Established validation schemas for creating tasks, quizzes, questions, and learning materials.
    *   Updated the lecturer-specific sidebar and class detail layouts to accommodate new navigation requirements for task and material management.

**Carry-over Work:**

Development continues on the lecturer dashboard feature branches for both repositories. Remaining tasks include final testing of the integrated create/modify workflows and ensuring consistent state management across the newly implemented task and material pages.
